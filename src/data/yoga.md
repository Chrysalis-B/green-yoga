## Green Yoga

Green Yoga wants to support you on your way to find your true self. The one that is behind all the thoughts, behind the voice in your head.
The one that is behind everything that society told you to be: We want to help you to remember who you truly are. 

As there are many ways to yoga Green Yoga offers a variety of tools and classes to help you in this process.
There is something for everybody: Calming Yin classes to relax your nervous system, energizing Vinyasa Flows, 
challenging Ashtanga classes, traditional Hatha classes, Kundalini Yoga to awaken your soul, Meditation to calm your monkey mind !
Moreover Green Yoga offers Singing Meditations to open your heart, Sound Healing and Gong Baths to go to an internal state of silence, 
peace and truth and dance classes to get in touch with your body and move freely.

All of our classes and offerings support you to reduce stress and tension, to create a harmonic union of body and mind and ultimately to reconnect to yourself.
