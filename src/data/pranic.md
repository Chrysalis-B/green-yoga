## Pranic Healing

Pranic Healing® is not intended to replace conventional medicine, but rather to complement it. Pranic Healing® is a highly developed system of energy based healing techniques that utilizes 'prana' to balance, harmonize and transform the body's energy processes. 'Prana' is a Sanskrit word that means 'life-force'. This invisible bioenergy or vital energy keeps the body alive and maintains a state of good health. In acupuncture, the Chinese refer to this subtle energy as 'Chi'.

Pranic Healing® is a simple, powerful and effective no-touch energy healing technique. It is based on the fundamental principle that the body is a 'self-repairing' living entity that possesses the innate ability to heal itself. Pranic Healing® works on the principle that the healing process is accelerated by increasing the life force or vital energy on the affected part of the physical body.

GrandMaster Choa Kok Sui, modern founder of Pranic Healing®, developed Pranic Healing over a 20 year period using experimentation and evidence-based research.
