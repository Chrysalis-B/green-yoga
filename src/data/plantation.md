## Plantation Project

The inception of Green Yoga in our Founder Sri´s words: “While in India in April, a time of the year where the sweltering heat is almost unbearable (45°), I noticed there were a lot of empty spaces outside many homes in his village. I decided to walk around and ask my neighbors if they were willing to plant a few trees in their yards, if I were to donate plants that bore fruits or flowers, which would be of use to them. They readily agreed and that was the inception of this project. So far I have donated 13000 Lemon, Jasmine, Mango,Custard Apple, Guava and some other varieties in 18 villages. The project is simple: I find a volunteer in the target village who would distribute the plants to every villager with space and willingness to plant them. I then order the saplings from a regional wholesale plantation to be delivered to the volunteer.”

So far, we have funded the project with 5% profits of the yoga studio. As we expand our operations across Germany with our co-founder Nora Schirmeier we look to increase the distribution of plants, maintenance of existing plants and find innovative ways to educate locals on fighting climate change. With every yoga session you do with us, you help in making the planet just a little greener. 5% of our profits goes towards Plantations. Alternatively you can purchase 50 plant donations for 100€. Together we can help beat pollution, fight Co2 levels, invite rains, nurture unused land and ultimately educate more people about Climate change.
