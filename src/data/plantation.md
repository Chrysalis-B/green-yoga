## Plantation Project

While in India in April, a time of the year where the sweltering heat is almost unbearable (45°), I noticed there were a lot of empty spaces outside many homes in my village. I decided to walk around and ask my neighbors if they were willing to plant a few trees in their yards, if I were to donate plants that bore fruits or flowers, which would be of use to them. They readily agreed and that was the inception of this project. So far I have donated 9000 Lemon, Jasmine, Mango,Custard Apple, Guava and some other varieties in 12 villages. The project is simple: I find a volunteer in the target village who would distribute the plants to every villager with space and willingness to plant them. I then order the saplings from a regional wholesale plantation to be delivered to the volunteer.

So far, I have funded the project with my savings. With additional funds I can scale up the plant donations exponentially. I invite you all to join me on this quest. With every yoga session you do with us, you help in making the planet just a little greener. 10% of what you pay for the class or a healing session goes towards Plantations. Alternatively you can purchase 400 plant donations for 100€ or 40 plant donations for 10€.

Together we can help beat pollution, fight Co2 levels, invite rains, nurture unused land and ultimately provide fruits to the villagers.
